# GARBAGE-CLASSIFICATION
EfficientNet-based garbage classification model using deep learning and transfer learning in Python.
# Garbage Classification using EfficientNet

This project uses deep learning (EfficientNetB0) and transfer learning to classify garbage into multiple categories (plastic, glass, metal, etc.) using TensorFlow.
